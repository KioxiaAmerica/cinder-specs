==========================================
Oracle ZFS Storage Appliance iSCSI Driver
==========================================

Include the URL of your launchpad blueprint:

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/cinder/+spec/oracle-zfssa-cinder-driver

ZFSSA ISCSI Driver is designed for ZFS Storage Appliance product
line (ZS3-2, ZS3-4, ZS3-ES, 7420 and 7320). The driver provides the ability
to create iSCSI volumes which are exposed from the ZFS Storage Appliance
for use by VM instantiated by Openstack's Nova module.


Problem description
===================

Currently there is no support for ZFS Storage Appliance product line from
Openstack Cinder.

Use Cases
=========

Proposed change
===============
iSCSI driver uses REST API to communicate out of band with the storage
controller.
The new driver would be located under cinder/volume/drivers/zfssa, and
it would be able to perform the following:

* Create/Delete Volume
* Extend Volume
* Create/Delete Snaphost
* Create Volume from Snapshot
* Delete Volume Snapshot
* Attach/Detach Volume
* Get Volume Stats

Additionaly a ZFS Storage Appliance workflow (cinder.akwf) is provided
to help the admin to setup a user and role in the appliance with enought
priviledges to do cinder operations.
Also, cinder.conf has to be configured properly with zfssa specific
properties for the driver to work.
