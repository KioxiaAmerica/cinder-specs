Consistency Groups
==========================================

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/cinder/+spec/consistency-groups

Today in Cinder, every operation happens at the volume level. Consistency
Groups (CGs) are needed for Data Protection (snapshots and backups) and
Disaster Recovery (remote replication). This blueprint will be introducing
Consistency Groups and discussing how it can be applied to snapshots.

Remote replication is covered in a different blueprint and will not be
discussed here.
https://blueprints.launchpad.net/cinder/+spec/volume-replication

Problem description
===================

Consistency Group support will be added for snapshots in phase 1 (Juno).

Future:

* After the Consistency Group is introduced and implemented for snapshots,
  it may be applied to backups. That will be after phase 1.

* Modify Consistency Group (adding existing volumes to CG and removing volumes
  from CG after it is created) will be supported after phase 1.

Assumptions:

* Cinder provides APIs that can be consumed by an orchestration layer.

* The orchestration layer has knowledge of what volumes should be grouped
  together.

* Volumes in a CG belong to the same backend.

* Volumes in a CG can have different volume types.


3 levels of quiesce:

* Application level: Not in Cinder's control

* Filesystem level: Cinder can call newly proposed Nova admin quiesce API
  which uses QEMU guest agent to freeze the guest filesystem before taking a
  snapshot of CG and thaw afterwards. However, this freeze feature in QEMU
  guest agent was just added to libvirt recently, so we can't rely on it yet.

* Storage level: Arrays can freeze IO before taking a snapshot of CG.  We can
  only rely on the storage level quiesce in phase 1 because the freeze feature
  mentioned above is not ready yet.

Use Cases
=========

Proposed change
===============

Consistency Groups work flow

* Create a CG, specifying volume types that can be supported by this CG.

  * Scheduler will figure out which backend can handle these volume types.
    The backend (host) will be saved in the CG table in the db.

* Create a volume and specify the CG.

  * This step will be repeated until all volumes are created for the CG.

* Create a snapshot of the CG.

  * Cinder API creates cgsnapshot and individual snapshot entries in the db
    and sends request to Cinder volume node.

  * Cinder manager calls novaclient which calls a new Nova admin API "quiesce"
    that uses QEMU guest agent to freeze the guest filesystem. Can leverage
    this work:
    https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Cinder/QuiescedSnapshotWithQemuGuestAgent
    (Note: This step will be on hold for now because the freeze feature is not
    reliable yet.)

  * Cinder manager calls Cinder driver.

  * Cinder driver communicates with backend array to create a point-in-time
    consistency snapshot of the CG.

  * Cinder manager calls novaclient which calls a new Nova admin API
    "unquiesce" that uses QEMU guest agent to thaw the guest filesystem.
    (Note: This step will be on hold for now.)

Alternatives
------------

One alternative is to not implement CG in Cinder, but rather implementing it
at the orchestration layer.  However, in that case, Cinder wouldn't know which
volumes are belonging to a CG.  As a result, user can delete a volume belonging
to the CG using Cinder CLI or Horizon without knowing the consequences.

Another alternative is not to implement CG at all.  User will be able to
operate at individual volume level, but can't provide crash consistent data
protection of multiple volumes in the same application.

Data model impact
-----------------

DB Schema Changes

* A new consistencygroups table will be created.

* A new cgsnapshots table will be created.

* Volume entries in volumes tables will have a foreign key of the
  consistencygroup uuid that they belong to.

* cgsnapshot entries in cgsnapshots table will have a foreign key of the
  consistencygroup uuid.

* snapshot entries in snapshots table will have a foreign key of the
  cgsnapshot uuid.

Alternatives:

Instead of adding a cgsnapshots table, add a label to the snapshots.
This label will be the cgsnapshot name. That means we need to make sure
the name is provided when creating a snapshot of the CG and it must be unique.

Security impact
---------------

None

Notifications impact
--------------------

Add event notifications.

Other end user impact
---------------------

Add a quota for maximum number of CGs per tenant.


python-cinderclient needs to be changed to support CG.  The following CLI
will be added.

To list all consistency groups:
 cinder consistencygroup-list

To create a consistency group:
 cinder consistencygroup-create --name <name> --description <description>
 --volume_type <type1,type2,...>

Example:
 cinder consistencygroup-create --name mycg --description "My CG"
 --volume_type lvm-1,lvm-2

To create a new volume and add it to the consistency group:
 cinder create --volume_type <type> --consistencygroup <cg uuid or name> <size>

To delete one or more consistency groups:
 cinder consistencygroup-delete <cg uuid or name> [<cg uuid or name> ...]

 cinder consistencygroup-show <cg uuid or name>


python-cinderclient needs to be changed to support snapshots.

To list snapshots of a consistency group:
 cinder consistencygroup-snapshot-list <cg uuid or name>

To create a snapshot of a consistency group:
 cinder consistencygroup-snapshot-create <cg uuid or name>

To show a snapshot of a consistency group:
 cinder consistencygroup-snapshot-show <cgsnapshot uuid or name>

To delete one or more snapshots:
 cinder consistencygroup-snapshot-delete <cgsnapshot uuid or name>
 [<cgsnapshot uuid or name> ...]


Performance Impact
------------------

None

Other deployer impact
---------------------

None

Developer impact
----------------
